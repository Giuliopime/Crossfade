    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 6, 2025</p>
    
    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Crossfade does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information to our servers. The app operates entirely on your device.</p>
    
    <h2>2. OAuth Authorization</h2>
    <p>To function properly, Crossfade requires authorization to access basic search functionality on music platforms (Apple Music, Spotify, YouTube, SoundCloud). This authorization:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Is performed using industry-standard OAuth 2.0 with PKCE</li>
        <li>Is entirely optional - you choose which platforms to authorize</li>
        <li>Stores authentication keys locally on your device only</li>
        <li>Never transmits your credentials to our servers</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>3. Data Usage</h2>
    <p>When you share a music link with Crossfade, the app:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fetches song information from the source platform</li>
        <li>Searches for the same song on other authorized platforms</li>
        <li>Displays results directly on your device</li>
        <li>Does not store or transmit this information anywhere</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>4. No Server or Data Storage</h2>
    <p>Crossfade operates without any backend servers. All processing happens locally on your device, ensuring complete privacy of your music preferences and usage patterns.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>This app interacts with third-party music platforms (Apple Music, Spotify, YouTube, SoundCloud) according to their respective privacy policies and terms of service.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.</p>
